# Market Problem

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are the backbone of modern organizations—but most of them were designed decades ago for a different era.

Today’s SaaS tools are often:

- Overly complex and hard to customize
- Siloed across departments and data sources
- Built for static processes, not real-time decisions
- Designed for operators, not intelligent agents
- Poorly integrated with the latest AI capabilities

In an environment where business decisions must be made faster, more adaptively, and across increasingly complex ecosystems, traditional ERP systems fall short.

At the same time, modern AI has unlocked new potential: from real-time reasoning and workflow orchestration to autonomous decision-making. Yet, no existing system bridges the gap between enterprise infrastructure and the power of foundation models or AGI-native intelligence.

Companies need a system that understands their business, acts proactively, and orchestrates operations across all functions. That's the gap Operio is built to fill.
