# Technology Stack

Operio is built upon a modern and scalable technology foundation engineered to support intelligent automation and real-time orchestration at enterprise scale. The stack integrates cutting-edge cloud infrastructure, robust backend services, advanced AI capabilities, and secure frontend interfaces to deliver a seamless operational experience.

## Core Infrastructure

Operio adopts a cloud-native architecture hosted on leading cloud providers, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and elastic resource management. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized microservices deployed via Docker, allowing modular components to scale independently and efficiently.

## Backend

The backend leverages a hybrid Node.js and Python environment, enabling rapid development and integration of core API services, autonomous AI agents, and the orchestration engine. GraphQL serves as the unified API layer, providing flexible and efficient data querying across disparate modules and services.

## AI and Machine Learning

At the heart of Operio’s intelligence lies its integration with foundation models such as OpenAI’s GPT and Anthropic’s Claude. These large language models power natural language understanding and generation, enabling human-like interaction and reasoning. Complementing this are custom-trained machine learning agents optimized for domain-specific functions including sales forecasting, procurement automation, and project workflow management. A contextual memory store, implemented via vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate, supports efficient semantic search and persistent operational context across modules.

## Data and Storage

Operio employs PostgreSQL as its primary relational database, ensuring reliable storage and management of structured business data. To minimize latency and accelerate data access, Redis is utilized for in-memory caching. Additionally, a centralized data lake consolidates unstructured data, system logs, and AI training inputs, enabling advanced analytics and continuous model improvement.

## Frontend

The user interface is crafted with React.js to deliver a responsive, intuitive dashboard and configuration experience. Styling is implemented through Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach that ensures consistency, rapid iteration, and adaptability across devices.

## Security and Compliance

Security is foundational to Operio’s architecture. OAuth2 and JWT protocols govern authentication and authorization, safeguarding access to resources. Data is protected end-to-end with encryption both in transit and at rest. Operio is designed to meet stringent compliance requirements including GDPR and SOC2, aligning with enterprise standards for data privacy and security.

Operio’s technology stack harmonizes scalability, intelligence, and security to empower enterprises with a future-proof platform capable of evolving alongside their operational needs.
