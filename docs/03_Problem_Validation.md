Small to mid-sized businesses (1-50 employees) spend 7-14 hours per person per week on manual administrative tasks (invoicing, order management, inventory tracking, price list updates, report generation, email communications, customer support, etc.) that could potentially be automated, preventing them from focusing on core business growth activities.

## Key Statistical Findings

#### 16 hours weekly average: SME owners and executives spend almost half of the average working week on administrative tasks

#### 2 full days equivalent: Executives spend an average of 16 hours per week on manual administrative work

#### 71 days annually: Small companies spend an average of 71 days per year on admin tasks

#### Â£35,600 annual cost: Average yearly financial impact of administrative burden on small companies
