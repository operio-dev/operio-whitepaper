# Scalability & Security

### Scalability

Operio is built to scale seamlessly with your business needs:

- **Microservices Architecture:** Each module and agent runs as an independent service, allowing horizontal scaling.
- **Cloud Elasticity:** Automatically adjusts compute resources based on demand, ensuring consistent performance.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Enables asynchronous communication between agents and modules, improving responsiveness and fault tolerance.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic evenly to prevent bottlenecks and ensure high availability.

### Security

Protecting sensitive business data is a top priority:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permission settings to control who can view or modify data.
- **Data Encryption:** All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.
- **Audit Logs:** Comprehensive logging of all system activity for compliance and forensic analysis.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Periodic penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate risks.
- **Compliance Standards:** Adherence to GDPR, SOC2, and other relevant regulatory requirements to protect privacy and data integrity.
