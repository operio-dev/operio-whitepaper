### Scalability & Security

**Scalability**

Operio is built to scale seamlessly with your business needs. Its microservices architecture allows each module and agent to run as an independent service, enabling horizontal scaling. The platform leverages cloud elasticity to automatically adjust compute resources based on demand, ensuring consistent performance at all times. An event-driven architecture enables asynchronous communication between agents and modules, improving responsiveness and fault tolerance. Load balancing distributes traffic evenly to prevent bottlenecks and maintain high availability.

**Security**

Protecting sensitive business data is a top priority for Operio. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides granular permission settings to control who can view or modify data. All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols. Comprehensive audit logs record all system activity to support compliance and forensic analysis. Regular security audits, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, help identify and mitigate risks. Operio adheres to GDPR, SOC2, and other relevant regulatory requirements to protect privacy and ensure data integrity.
