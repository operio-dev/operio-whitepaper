# Technology Stack

Operio is built upon a modern and scalable technology foundation engineered to support intelligent automation and real-time orchestration at enterprise scale. The stack integrates cutting-edge cloud infrastructure, robust backend services, advanced AI capabilities, and secure frontend interfaces to deliver a seamless operational experience.

## Core Infrastructure

Operio adopts a cloud-native architecture hosted on leading cloud providers, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and elastic resource management. Kubernetes orchestrates containerized microservices deployed via Docker, allowing modular components to scale independently and efficiently.

## Backend

The backend leverages a hybrid Node.js and Python environment, enabling rapid development and integration of core API services, autonomous AI agents, and the orchestration engine. GraphQL serves as the unified API layer, providing flexible and efficient data querying across disparate modules and services.

## AI and Machine Learning

At the heart of Operio’s intelligence lies its integration with foundation models such as OpenAI’s GPT and Anthropic’s Claude. These large language models power natural language understanding and generation, enabling human-like interaction and reasoning. Complementing this are custom-trained machine learning agents optimized for domain-specific functions including sales forecasting, procurement automation, and project workflow management. A contextual memory store, implemented via vector databases like Pinecone or Weaviate, supports efficient semantic search and persistent operational context across modules.

## Data and Storage

Operio employs PostgreSQL as its primary relational database, ensuring reliable storage and management of structured business data. To minimize latency and accelerate data access, Redis is utilized for in-memory caching. Additionally, a centralized data lake consolidates unstructured data, system logs, and AI training inputs, enabling advanced analytics and continuous model improvement.

## Frontend

The user interface is crafted with React.js to deliver a responsive, intuitive dashboard and configuration experience. Styling is implemented through Tailwind CSS, providing a utility-first approach that ensures consistency, rapid iteration, and adaptability across devices.

## Security and Compliance

Security is foundational to Operio’s architecture. OAuth2 and JWT protocols govern authentication and authorization, safeguarding access to resources. Data is protected end-to-end with encryption both in transit and at rest. Operio is designed to meet stringent compliance requirements including GDPR and SOC2, aligning with enterprise standards for data privacy and security.

Operio’s technology stack harmonizes scalability, intelligence, and security to empower enterprises with a future-proof platform capable of evolving alongside their operational needs.


# 07 — Scalability & Security

Operio is designed from day one to support both vertical and horizontal scaling, with robust security principles embedded at every layer of the system. We believe that a modern ERP must be both agile and trustworthy — ready to scale with growing teams, while protecting their most sensitive operational data.

## Scalability Architecture

- **Microservice-Oriented Core**:  
  Modular backend with clear boundaries between product modules (Sales, Finance, HR, etc.), allowing services to scale independently based on usage.

- **Agent-Centric Load Isolation**:  
  Agent processes (AI tasks, memory management, etc.) are executed in isolated environments via containerized jobs or serverless functions (e.g. Vercel Functions, Lambda), ensuring compute-intensive tasks don't affect core app performance.

- **Elastic Infrastructure**:  
  Deployed initially on platforms like **Railway**, **Render**, or **Fly.io**, with the ability to migrate to full **Kubernetes clusters** when higher control is needed. Services auto-scale based on usage patterns.

- **Database Sharding & Read Replicas**:  
  PostgreSQL is used as the primary database with support for horizontal sharding (by tenant) and read replicas for high-volume operations.

- **Vector DB Scalability**:  
  Weaviate or Pinecone are used for scalable, production-grade vector storage, capable of handling millions of embeddings with low-latency retrieval.

## Security Principles

- **Zero-Trust Architecture**:  
  Every request is authenticated and authorized explicitly, with no assumptions based on origin.

- **Data Encryption**:  
  - At rest: AES-256 encrypted storage  
  - In transit: All connections secured with TLS 1.3

- **Authentication & Access Control**:  
  - OAuth2 / SSO support  
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) ready  
  - Fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Audit Logging & Traceability**:  
  All critical actions (financial changes, user permissions, etc.) are logged and available for audit review.

- **Agent Safety Layer**:  
  AGI agents run in sandboxed environments with limited scope, ensuring they cannot act beyond assigned permissions. Every agent action is logged and explainable.

- **Compliance by Design**:  
  - GDPR-ready architecture  
  - Optional SOC 2 Type I implementation for enterprise clients  
  - Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing (from Series A)
