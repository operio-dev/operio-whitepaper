# Problem Validation Research Summary & Problem Impact

AI-Native ERP for Small to Mid-Sized Businesses

## Problem Statement

Small to mid-sized businesses (1-50 employees) spend 7-14 hours per person per week on manual administrative tasks (invoicing, order management, inventory tracking, price list updates, report generation, email communications, customer support, etc.) that could potentially be automated, preventing them from focusing on core business growth activities.

## Key Statistical Findings

### Time Burden Validation

#### 16 hours per week:
Small business owners spend 2 out of 5 working days on administrative work

#### 16 hours weekly average: 
SME owners and executives spend almost half of the average working week on administrative tasks

#### 2 full days equivalent:
Executives spend an average of 16 hours per week on manual administrative work

#### 71 days annually: 
Small companies spend an average of 71 days per year on admin tasks

#### £35,600 annual cost: 
Average yearly financial impact of administrative burden on small companies

# Specific Task Confirmation

## Administrative burdens include:

- Juggling spreadsheets

- Managing employee schedules

- Drowning in client emails

- Issuing invoices and following up on overdue payments

- Managing bills and payment processing

- Recording transactions and preparing regulatory reports

- Responding to client/lead requests

- Email management and communication

# Business Impact Evidence

## Growth Prevention: 
Administrative tasks chip away at valuable time, leaving fewer hours to innovate and engage with customers

## Core Activity Displacement: 
Tasks that help the company's bottom line get sidelined or pushed to evening and weekend hours

## Productivity Loss: 
Time spent on non-specialized administrative work reduces focus on revenue-generating activities

## Scale Limitation: 
Manual processes prevent businesses from growing efficiently

# Target Market Validation

- Research consistently focuses on small businesses in the 1-50 employee range

- Problem affects SME owners, executives, and team members across the organization

- Issue is universal across different industries and business types

# Problem Impact

Welcome to the Problem Impact phase.

Now that we've identified your problem and its scale, it's time to quantify the real impact in measurable terms. We'll work together to calculate exactly what those 7-14 hours of manual administrative work cost individuals and businesses — whether that's in lost productivity, missed opportunities, or direct financial impact.

This will give you concrete numbers to communicate the value of your AI-native ERP solution. Ready to dive in and start quantifying the impact?

## Individual Level Impact

You mentioned that people spend 7-14 hours per week on manual administrative tasks. To quantify this impact, we need to understand what this time costs them personally and professionally.

The most significant ways this time burden impacts individuals are:

- **Stress** it creates  
- Time lost that could be spent doing something valuable

### Opportunity Cost

When someone spends 7-14 hours weekly on manual admin tasks, that's time they can't spend on value-creating activities. In a typical SMB, there is a substantial hourly value difference between manual admin work and high-value activities such as business development, strategic planning, or core product work.

For example, if admin work creates €0 in business value per hour, but strategic work could generate €50-100+ per hour in business impact, the opportunity cost per person is significant.

## Quantifying the Impact

Based on European SMB salary data:

- **EU average full-time monthly salary:** ~€3,155  
- **Major economies:** Germany (€4,250), France (€3,555), Italy (€2,729), Spain (€2,716)  

Assuming SMB employees earn around €2,500-€3,500/month (€15-€20/hour), here is the estimated opportunity cost:

- **7-14 hours weekly on manual admin = €105-€280 direct time cost**  
- **Opportunity cost (value lost by not doing high-value work) = roughly €200-€600 per person per week**

Does this hourly wage range seem reasonable for your target SMB market? If yes, we can proceed.

## Stress and Quality of Life Impact

In addition to financial costs, the stress burden and work-life imbalance are significant:

- Small business owners list "managing my business" as their most common personal stressor  
- Nearly two-thirds work more than 40 hours a week; one-third work over 50 hours  
- 62% say stress of ownership is worse than expected  
- 63% of business owners work more than 50 hours weekly, but ideally want to work ~42 hours  
- Emails and administrative tasks are identified as the biggest time wasters, with admin tasks ranking second (24%)

## Summary of Individual Impact

| Impact Area                | Description                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Financial Opportunity** | €200-600 weekly lost value per person due to manual admin work |
| **Stress Burden**          | High stress linked to admin tasks and business management       |
| **Work-Life Imbalance**    | Majority working excessive hours beyond desired levels          |

This translates to an **annual value of €10,000-30,000+ per individual** that your AI-native ERP solution can potentially unlock by saving 7-14 hours weekly and reducing stress.
