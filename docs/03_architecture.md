# Architecture

Operio is designed as a modular, agent-based operating system for the enterprise. Its architecture is built around five key pillars:

### 1. Agent-Led Modules
Each core business function (Sales, Finance, HR, Operations, Projects, etc.) is powered by a specialized autonomous agent. These agents understand goals, monitor context, and interact across modules to execute tasks or recommend actions.

### 2. Contextual Memory Layer
A centralized memory system stores operational state, interaction history, and business objectives. This allows agents to reason over past decisions, anticipate future needs, and provide continuity across modules.

### 3. Realtime Orchestration Engine
The orchestration engine coordinates agents, workflows, and external data in real time. It ensures that modules remain in sync and that decision logic adapts to changing conditions.

### 4. Composable Modules
Modules can be enabled or disabled independently. Each module (e.g., CRM, Inventory, Projects, Finance) is built with open APIs and shares a unified ontology, making it easy to extend or replace.

### 5. AGI-Native Core
At the foundation sits an interface to foundation models (LLMs) and multimodal agents, optimized for enterprise reasoning. This AGI-native layer handles task planning, workflow generation, and interaction with users or external APIs.

This architecture enables a new class of ERP: one that doesn't just track your business, but understands and evolves with it.
