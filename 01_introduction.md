# Introduction

Operio is an AGI-native modular ERP built for companies that want intelligent automation, not just digital bureaucracy. In a world where most enterprise systems are still complex, rigid, and disconnected from real-time business intent, Operio offers a radically new foundation.

Instead of static software modules, Operio introduces autonomous agents designed to understand your business context, anticipate needs, and act on your behalf. It blends the simplicity of no-code, the power of modularity, and the intelligence of foundation models into a single operating system for the modern enterprise.

Whether you're orchestrating sales, managing projects, or optimizing operations, Operio adapts to your workflows and evolves with your goals. This whitepaper outlines the vision, architecture, and technical backbone behind Operio, and why we believe it's the right system for the post-LLM, post-CRM era.

Welcome to the ERP that understands you.
